<hr>

<body bgcolor="silver">

    
  <h4><p>Ever since I was young, 
    I've always been curious about 
    how things on the internet worked.
    Like when i used websites like chrome
    or played online games,
    id catch myself thinking,
    "how did they even make this?" I wasnt just using the tech
    I wanted to understand it.</p>  <br>
    There's no way I could ever build something like this.
      " It seemed so complicated, and every time I tried to learn something new,
       I’d hit a wall and feel like I wasn’t making any progress. 
       It wasn’t until I started with small, simple projects—just trying to make a basic webpage or tweak a little code—that things started to click.
        It was slow, but over time, the pieces came together. It’s all about starting small, not trying to jump to the big stuff right away,
         and just sticking with it, even when it feels impossible.<br>

      <p>At first, i didnt really know anything about programming or IT.
       But  the more i saw how technology was changing everything,
      the more i got interested. I'd watch radom videos of how the game or websites made out of
      even trying to learn how to code but hte problem is i dont have access to any computers 
      i was too curious how to code.
   </p><br>
  <p> Another big reason I chose BSIT was because of my uncle.
    He took up IT back then, 
    and now he’s doing really well financially stable, 
    working a good job, 
    and living comfortably.
    He once told me that going into IT changed his life, 
     and hearing that made me realize that this path could really open doors—not just for me,
    but maybe for my family too.</p><br></h4>
 <h1 style="text-align: center;"> So I chose BSIT </h1>
 <p><h4>because I was curious, inspired, and I saw the potential.
    I want to build something someday—maybe even something people like me would wonder,
   “How did they make this?”</p><br></h4>
